# Enterprise_Reports_Automation

# Introduction
This repository contains some selected projects that I completed during my internship as a software developer, which includes mainly four categories of tasks:
    - Type1: Automating business report worflows
    - Type2: Automating PL/SQL scripts for database administrators
    - Type3: Converting legacy system (such as code written in SAS, VBA Macros, MySQL, etc.) to scalable python-based workflows
    - Type4: Developing small software applications used internally by business analysts

# Notes
I have removed some files and parts of the source code to protect the confidential information and interlectual properties of the company, only keeping necessary code to demonstrate the workflows.
